Gcov found that only 25.04% of lines were executed when I ran the unit tests,
which is pretty abominable. Generally you want to shoot for at least 80%, much
like grades 70% is average, 80% is pretty good, >90% is amazing. 25.04% is 
indicative of failure.  This implies that the other 75% of the lines are 
not being executed, which is 75% of lines that could have a bug in them that 
we don't know about. This is generally what's implied by code coverage -- the 
number of lines that you are at least touching with your tests, indicating
that those lines are at least not horribly horribly broken. But if a line is 
never touched how would you know?  

Granted, this perspective is a little misguided -- a high code coverage 
percentage does not imply that your tests are *good*, but higher coverage 
is better than low coverage.
